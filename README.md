# üî¨ Hands-on Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of hands-on projects in data science, machine learning, and forecasting. This repository is a growing collection of practical and applied examples using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and various ML libraries. I‚Äôll be adding more projects over time, so stay tuned!

## üìÅ Current Projects

### 1. ‚è±Ô∏è Time Series Forecasting: Electric Power Consumption
- **Notebook**: [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb)
- **Description**: 
  - Analyzes household electric power consumption data
  - Builds ARIMA and Prophet models to forecast power usage
  - Evaluates forecasting accuracy using RMSE and visual diagnostics

- **Skills Used**: 
  - Time Series Analysis (ARIMA, Prophet)
  - Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, fbprophet
  - Data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation
